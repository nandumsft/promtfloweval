Fulfillment Ratio measures the percentage of your criteria that were met. If you had 4 criteria and all were met, your fulfillment ratio is 100%. If 3 were met, it's 75%, and so on.
To calculate the Fulfillment Ratio, you should count the number of criteria met, divide by the total number of criteria, and multiply by 100 to get a percentage. For example, if 3 out of 4 criteria were met, your fulfillment ratio would be (3/4)*100 = 75%.
